<p><strong>How can you be safe while you're boating?</strong></p>



<p>Wear a P.F.D. (Personal Flotation Device, sometimes called a life jacket) even if you have been on a boat before and can swim.</p>



<p>Plan ahead and check the weather forecast for the weather when you go boating or go on a boating trip for the weekend or just a ride.</p>



<p>You have to be 16 years or older to drive a boat. To drive a boat you also have to take a mail-in test that you mail in when you're done taking the test. Then you're approved to drive a boat.</p>



<p>It's against the law if you pass a buoy if you don't read or obey the buoy. It is against the law to drive a boat in a swimming area with a sign that says  KEEP OUT... SWIMMING AREA .</p>



<p>It's against the law to drive a boat loaded with too many people. You can not drive irresponsibly. You need to sit in the boat area and not lean over the edge.</p>
